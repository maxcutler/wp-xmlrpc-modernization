This plugin updates the WordPress XML-RPC API to leverage the latest features of WordPress
and move beyond the historical Blogger/metaWeblog/MT APIs.

== Description ==

This plugin brings XML-RPC API enhancements from the WordPress 3.4 release to previous versions
of WordPress (3.3 and earlier). It also adds new user management methods.

It is derived from Prasath Nadarajah's GSoC '11 project to expand WordPress' web services,
although the exposed API methods are not compatible (different parameter names/types/orders).
