As part of WordPress's Google Summer of Code 2011, Prasath Nadarajah worked on enhancements to WordPress'
XML-RPC API. His code can be found at http://gsoc.svn.wordpress.org/2011/nprasath002/, and blog reports
at http://gsoc2011.wordpress.com/tag/wp-webservices/.

Using Prasath's work as a starting point, this project's goal is to create a patch ready for integration
into WordPress core. The WP XML-RPC API has fallen behind the core feature set of WordPress, missing
features like Custom Post Types and Custom Taxonomies. Such disparity is holding back possibilities in
the mobile apps and in integration with other software.
